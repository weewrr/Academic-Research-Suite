Did you diff the intended config against a reference / baseline run?\n  2. Does the run name describe the experiment in plain English (no internal codes like wave-1, phase-internal, etc.)?\n  3. Are dataset and checkpoint paths confirmed to exist (ls them)?\n  4. Is monitoring set up (wandb / tensorboard / neptune)?\n  5. If this is a restart, are stale artifacts purged (local + remote + tracker)?\nThe `/phd-skills:launch` skill walks all five with auto-detection. Run it if you want a structured pass."}}
